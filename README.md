# How does the integrated gateway works ?
<p> In the donate here section, once the user clicks on donate button, the user lands on the payment page where he/she can enter the required amount and select the payment type 
such as credit card, debit card, UPI, etc. Once the payment is done, an invoice is generated and emailed to the respective user's email id.</p>
